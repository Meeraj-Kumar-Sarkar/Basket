# Cute Cat Arc (Basket)

This is a web-app made from simple HTML, CSS, JavaScript. The project has been published into Netlify, so it is accessable through any mobile [Click Here](cute-cat-arc.netlify.app)

## ✨ App Functionality

1. The website is connected to a Firebase database so you can get the data from anywhere you want.

2. It works as an application to remind you your shopping-list.

3. The code is right here so feel free to add functionality if you like by making a branch

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **Firebase Realtime Database (v9 Modular SDK)**

## 🧪 How It Works

1. User types an item in the input field.

2. Upon clicking "Add to cart", the item is pushed to the Firebase DB.

3. The onValue() listener fetches and updates the list dynamically.

4. Clicking an item removes it from both the DOM and the database.

## ⚠️ Security Note: The Firebase database used is open to read/write operations for demo/testing purposes. For production, ensure proper authentication and database rules are set up to avoid unauthorized access in real world.
